### ORID Report - Emily ###


#### Objective: What Did We Learn/Do Today?
Today, we focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), learnt about what is retrospective and held a retrospective session. We also engaged in a mini team competition on hotkeys. These activities helped us enhance our skills and foster teamwork.

#### Reflective: My Feelings
I found the day enjoyable. The mix of learning and friendly competition created a positive atmosphere, making it easy to engage and participate.

#### Interpretive: Why?
I have learnt about some basic about OOP before, but I am not familiar with it, so I think it is a good chance for me to refresh and enhance my knowledge in OOP. 
Winning the hotkey competition also made the learning process fun and build a sense of connection with my team members. I find this kind of learning activity really enjoyable and add some element of excitment to the class. 

#### Direction: Action Points - What Changes Will I Make?
I'm not very familiar with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but I’ll do my best to keep up with the class and improve my understanding. During our retrospective meeting, it was noted that we’ve been somewhat inactive this week. I plan to be more engaged in our group and work on fostering better collaboration among us.
